# DealerBot
A robot that has AI at its core in the form of object detection. The DealerBot will be able to identify any card on the table and with its mechatronic arm will also be able to pick and drop the identified cards, making it possible to play the roll of a normal casino dealer or even a player at any card-based game!

#
Although the idea of a robotic casino dealer has already been realized, these implementations all resort to fixed card positions, whereas with DealerBot and its AI feature it is possible to take a more dynamic approach by locating any card at any time making it flexible and
more appealing to players.
